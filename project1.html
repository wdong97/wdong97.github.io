    <h3>modeling human behavior through language models</h3>

        <p class="project-description-p"> to gain a better understanding of how people are influenced, i trained a <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/02/exploring-transfer-learning-with-t5.html" target="_blank">t5 language model</a>
        to generate tweets with either pro-mask or anti-mask sentiment. the goal of this trained model was to essentially emulate human thought and behavior as an extension of behavioral analytics.</p>
        <p class="project-description-p"> i created a scraper to collect relevant tweets to use as my dataset for training, and built a self-iterative pipeline to classify sentiment on unseen data which is then used as input for text generation.</p>
        <p class="project-description-p"> an example of the tweets generated from the current state of the model are displayed to the left.</p>
        <img src="Images/maskoutput.png" alt="example text from mask tweet generation">
        <p class="project-description-p"> the next steps for this project are to improve model output, and derive thought processes as a concept for a client.</p>
